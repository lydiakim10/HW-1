## Description
Making sure that the HTML and CSS code has a structural flow is a crucial step in coding. However, another significant task to coders is to ensure that a website is accessible for all users, including those with disabilities. For those who rely on assistive technologies such as screen readers, captions, and braille keyboards, it is imperative to include code that allows them to use the site with the same ease as those who don't. Through this challenge, I was able to learn about the different codes that coders use to guarantee accessibility to all users, such as alternative descriptions and titles to images.
